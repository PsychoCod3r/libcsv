This is a temporary documentation file until I get some actual man
pages written.


libcsv defines the following data types:

csv_table - a handle for a table structure
csv_record - a handle for a single record within a table
csv_field - a single field in the CSV header

Ideally, only the csv_table type should be accessed directly, but I
understand that until I implement more of the interface, use of some of
the internal implementation components may be necessary. Thank you for
your patience. :)


libcsv defines the following functions:

bool csv_validate_file( FILE *fp, bool has_header )
Takes a file pointer for the CSV file and a Boolean indicating whether
the file is supposed to have a header; returns true if the file is valid
CSV, false otherwise

csv_table *csv_read_table( FILE *fp, bool has_header )
Reads a CSV file and builds a table structure based on that file,
returning a pointer to the table structure

void csv_write_table( FILE *fp, csv_table *table, bool has_header )
Writes a CSV table structure back to the file pointed to by fp


libcsv has one dependency: libdfloat. libdfloat can be found in the
libdfloat repository on my GitHub (github.com/PsychoCod3r).


Installation and usage instructions:

1. Download libcsv and libdfloat repositories and merge them into
   one folder.

2. Run the following commands:
   gcc -c csv-file.c dfloat.c
   ar -rsv libcsv.a csv-file.o
   ar -rsv libdfloat.a dfloat.o

3. To link the libcsv and libdfloat libraries to a project, run the
   following command:
   gcc myproject -L dir -lcsv -ldfloat
   (where dir is the directory containing libcsv.a and libdfloat.a)
