## The Apolitical Code of Conduct

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Purpose of this CoC:**

This CoC was made in response to other CoC's which the author sees
as attempts to politicize coding projects and thought-police their
contributers, a practice that is counter-productive to the actual
process of coding. These CoC's claim to be about inclusion but they
are really about *exclusion* of those who disagree with the mob. This
CoC is designed to prevent such exclusionary practices. If people with
non-mainstream ideological views are not welcome, then this defeats the
purpose of having a CoC. The four clauses of this CoC are listed below.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Clause 1: Demographic Inclusiveness:**

This project accepts everyone of any race, ethnicity, nationality, sex,
gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, disability,
marital status, relationship status, veteran status, occupation, or
socio-economic class. Any attempt to exclude an individual from this
project on the basis of any of these demographic qualities will be seen
as a violation of this CoC.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Clause 2: Ideological Inclusiveness:**

This project does not thought-police or discriminate against anyone for
political or ideological reasons. This project will not engage in Cancel
Culture or attempt to exclude anyone for exercising their right to free
speech and freedom of expression in other forums. Any attempt to
exclude an individual from this project on the basis of their political,
philosophical, ideological, moral, or ethical views will be seen as a
violation of this CoC.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Clause 3: Political Neutrality:**

This project will maintain a stance of political neutrality on every
issue, unless such issues directly concern the safety of our users or
contributers and threaten to do tangible harm to them. Any attempt to
force the project to take an official position on any issue will be seen
as a violation of this CoC.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Clause 4: Apolitical Discourse:**

Politics and ideology will not be discussed within the forum of this
project, unless it involves issues directly concerning this project. Any
attempt to bring up politics or try to force one's political or
ideological views on other members of the project will be seen as a
violation of this CoC. There's a place for political discussion and
debates, and it's not here. We're here to work on code, not to try to
convert other people.
