### Sections:

1. This document is a binding legal contract between all parties involved
   in the production, modification, distribution, redistribution, or
   use of any software released under the terms of this license, or
   in the combination of FSL-licensed software with other software,
   or in the production, modification, distribution, redistribution,
   combination, or use of any software derived from FSL-licensed software.
   Anyone who creates, modifies, distributes, redistributes, uses, or
   combines any such software implicitly agrees to the terms of this
   contract in doing so.

2. All software released under the Micheal Warren FSL is provided AS IS
   with absolutely no warranty, not even the implied warranty of fitness
   for a particular application.  Neither Michael Warren nor any author
   or contributor to any FSL-licensed software may be held responsible
   for any damages that may result from use or misuse of FSL-licensed
   software.  An FSL contributor may provide a warranty, technical
   support, or additional guarantees on top of the initial agreement, but
   no warranty or liability is implied unless the contributor explicitly
   provides for it.

3. All software released under the Michael Warren FSL is open source.
   The source code does not have to be provided with the software, but
   it does have to be made publicly available and easily accessible.
   Additionally, this license prohibits any use of intentional obfuscation
   techniques designed to prevent reverse-engineering of FSL software.

4. This license prohibits any use of telemetry or surveillance for
   any purpose - commercial, legal, or otherwise.  Additionally, all
   contributors, authors, and users of FSL software must know that if
   any entity attempts to pressure them to install backdoors or other
   surveillance techniques in FSL software, then they are legally required
   to refuse such demands, and any compliance with such demands amounts
   to breach of contract.

5. Anyone who modifies or rereleases a piece of FSL software must give
   credit to any previous authors or contributors to that software
   whenever possible.  All information regarding the identities of those
   who contributed must be preserved, unless such information includes
   personally identifiable information (PII) that could be used to
   inflict harm on one or more of those individuals.  In essence, the
   entire chain of custody of the software must be preserved.

6. FSL software may be combined with non-FSL software under certain
   conditions, which will be detailed in the following paragraph.
   If such combination occurs, then only the FSL-licensed or FSL-derived
   portion of the product is affected by the terms of this license.
   FSL-licensed software may be combined with closed-source software, as
   long as the source code for the FSL-licensed portion is made public.
   However, FSL software may not under any circumstances be combined
   with software that violates Section 4 of this license.

7. Michael Warren has final say on any confusions that may arise regarding
   the interpretation of any clause of the present document.  Furthermore,
   Michael Warren reserves the right to modify this document at any time,
   without notice, in order to deal with any unanticipated legal or other
   issues that may arise with regards to this license or any software
   released under its terms.

*Note: Software derived from FSL-licensed software and released under
a different license or a closed-source license is bound by Sections 4,
5, and 6 of the FSL but not by Sections 2 and 3.*
