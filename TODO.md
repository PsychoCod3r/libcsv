The following are upcoming changes I plan to make in future releases of this software...

- Expand `csv_string` type into `csv_ascii`, `csv_utf8`, and `csv_utf16` types and provide the option to parse Unicode strings.
- Expand `csv_number` type into `csv_dfloatN` and `csv_int` types and provide the option to read either `int` types or `dfloat` types of different widths.
- Add functions for working with `csv_table` types that are analogous to the commands used by a relational database system.
- Add the ability to search for and extract subsets of CSV records from a `csv_table` structure based on mathematical conditions and regular expressions.
